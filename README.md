# 2D Ising Model - Monte Carlo Simulation

It plots magnetization - temperature graph. Number of spins, spin values, iterations and temperatures are
dynamic so, you can change as you wish. I have used periodic boundary conditions.

Coded for bachelor thesis.

## Requirements

### Dependencies

- Numpy
- Numba
- Matplotlib.pyplot

I have used numba to make process faster.

## Figures

Here are the some figures from different iterations. As you can see, fluctuations decrease while iterations are increasing. To decrease fluctuations in the systems which have more particles, requires more time elapsed.
